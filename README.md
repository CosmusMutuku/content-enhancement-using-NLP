# Educational Content Enhancement Project

## Overview

The Educational Content Enhancement Project is a Flask-based web application designed to preprocess, analyze, and enhance educational content. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean, analyze sentiment, assess readability, and generate summaries of educational materials. This README provides an overview of the project and how to set it up and use it.

## Project Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **content.py**: This module contains Python code for various NLP tasks, including tokenization, sentiment analysis, readability assessment, automatic summarization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and word frequency visualization.

2. **app.py**: The Flask web application responsible for serving the NLP functionalities through a user-friendly web interface. Users can input educational content, and the application will provide enhanced content, sentiment analysis, readability assessment, and a summary.

3. **index.html**: The HTML template for the web interface where users can input educational content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Gensim
- Textstat
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib


## Project Structure
The repository structure is organized as follows:

- 'content.py': Python script containing NLP functions.
- 'app.py': Flask web application for serving the NLP functionalities.
- 'index.html': HTML template for the web interface.
- 'styles.css': CSS stylesheet for styling the web interface.
- 'script.js': JavaScript for handling user interactions on the web page.
